# Temperature Converter

The Temperature Converter is a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, providing a quick and convenient way to switch between the two commonly used temperature scales.

## Features

- Temperature Conversion: The converter provides bi-directional conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures.
- Real-Time Update: The conversion is performed in real-time as the user enters the temperature value, without the need for any submit buttons.
- Simple and User-Friendly: The application has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to use and understand.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The temperature converter will be displayed, showing input fields for both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures.
3. Enter the temperature value in either Celsius or Fahrenheit field.
4. As you enter the value, the corresponding conversion will be displayed instantly in the other field.

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the temperature converter and handles user interactions.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the logic for temperature conversion and real-time updating.

## Customization

You can customize the Temperature Converter by modifying the following aspects:

- Design: Feel free to modify the CSS file to change the appearance of the converter, such as colors, fonts, or layout, to match your preferences.
- Additional Features: If you want to add more temperature scales (e.g., Kelvin) or additional functionalities (e.g., conversion history), you can extend the JavaScript code accordingly.

## Browser Compatibility

The Temperature Converter is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should be compatible with most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
